# TODO
- [ ] Take screenshots of the main screen
  - [x] Test it 
  - [x] `Backblaze` upload
  - [ ] configure ipc to capture the screenshot every x time

- [x] Add dragable point in toolbar window

- [ ] Remove the tray when the app it's close

- [x] Learn about app quit events and window close events in windows
Maybe creating a variable that track if there's a journey active will help whether to quit the app or just hide the windows
